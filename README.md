# Functionalities

**Home Screen**: Here we can see all the blocks that have been added to our chain along with their details and also the transactions inside them.

**Create Transactions**: Here we can create a new transaction from our account to any other account that we want. Upon creating the transaction it is added to the list of pending transactions ready to be mined.
